  # CAPTCHA Generator

    ## Overview
    This is a simple Python-based CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) generator. It creates random alphanumeric CAPTCHA images that can be used for various authentication purposes.

    ## Features
    - Generates random alphanumeric CAPTCHA text
    - Creates CAPTCHA images with customizable dimensions
    - Saves CAPTCHA images to specified location
    - Easy to integrate with other applications
    - Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
    - Includes digits for increased complexity
    - Automatically displays generated CAPTCHA image

    ## Requirements
    - Python 3.6 or higher
    - Pillow library (`pip install pillow`)
    - captcha library (`pip install captcha`)

    ## Installation
    1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AMPoet/Captcha_Generator.git
    ```
    2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Captcha_Generator
    ```
    3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ## Usage
    ### Basic Usage
    ```python
    from Captcha import generate_and_save_captcha

    # Generate a CAPTCHA with default settings
    captcha_text = generate_and_save_captcha()
    print(f"Generated CAPTCHA: {captcha_text}")
    ```

    ### Advanced Usage
    ```python
    from Captcha import generate_and_save_captcha

    # Generate a CAPTCHA with custom settings
    captcha_text = generate_and_save_captcha(
        image_width=400,
        image_height=150,
        captcha_length=8,
        image_path='path/to/save/captcha.png'
    )
    ```

    ## Parameters
    - `image_width`: Width of the CAPTCHA image (default: 280)
    - `image_height`: Height of the CAPTCHA image (default: 90)
    - `captcha_length`: Length of the CAPTCHA text (default: 6)
    - `image_path`: Path to save the generated CAPTCHA image (default: 'your path / captcha.png')

    ## Security Considerations
    - Use longer CAPTCHA lengths (8+ characters) for higher security
    - Consider adding distortion or noise to the images for better security
    - Store CAPTCHA text securely for validation
    - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

    ## Performance
    - Generates CAPTCHA images in milliseconds
    - Lightweight and efficient
    - Minimal memory usage

    ## Future Enhancements
    - Add support for different fonts and styles
    - Implement image distortion and noise
    - Add support for mathematical CAPTCHAs
    - Create a web interface for CAPTCHA generation
    - Add support for different languages

    ## Testing
    To run the included tests:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```
